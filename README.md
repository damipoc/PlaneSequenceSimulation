# PlaneSequenceSimulation





Running the simulation and instructions

The whole code is in one source file named `boardingSequence.py` and it was created using Python 3.9.2 64-bit, no additional libraries were used so only python is needed to run the file. 

`planeIcon.ico` should be kept in the same folder as the python file since it serves as the GUI’s icon. 

Using the simulator is fairly simple, first, the layout must be chosen, it is set to default by itself, after that the boarding method is selected, BTF being the default one, and finally, the simulation speed is chosen, fast is useful if quick results are needed otherwise medium and slow should be used if animation is desired. 

Once everything is selected the “Start” button is pressed and the simulation will start based on which layout and boarding method is selected.

On the top of the GUI, the “Tick” score and the “Seats” will be updated in real-time in order to indicate how many seats are occupied. 

Once the simulation finishes the final tick result will be shown. This can be used to compare different methods.
